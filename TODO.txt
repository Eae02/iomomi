fixes:
 - velocity is too high after moving down ramp
 - water should be affected by force fields
 - physics object rotation
 - gravity barriers still have collision when disabled
 - standing on button is awkward

graphics fixes:
 - fix hidden water still rendering when underwater
 - gun should be rendered after ssr
 - ssr should be done later (so that transparents are reflected)

textures and models:
 - textures in level change room
 - textures for ramps
 - better side model for gravity barriers
 - texture and model for cube spawner
 - different graphics for pushable platforms
 - more window types
 - make objects glow when gravity has been changed
 - particles (or other visuals) to show current gravity of objects
 - particles when water splashes
 - decorative mesh entities

features:
 - zero gravity mode
 - barriers that prevent falling
 - levers
 - activatable force fields
 - moving force fields
 - water drains and emitters

editor:
 - undo stack
 - double click to select area
